# PyJunkies

Bunch of devs addicted to Python. We like coding, science and computers generally.

## About Us
We are just old friends who from time to time code together.  We like coding, science and computers generally.

Here are some projects on which we participated:

- [Swaglr](http://www.swaglr.com/swags/all/)
- [DSSOS](http://dss-pyjunkies.rhcloud.com/)
- [Cru.do](http://cru.do)
- [Edicio.us](http://edicio.us)
- [Quicklook](https://bitbucket.org/radekhofman/quicklook/overview)

### How was the development?

Generally, we had a lot of fun. Partly also because of the third member of our team---Jean Pierre---who always suddenly emerged from nowhere:

We were not able to use the whole dedicated time but we think we succeeded and are satisfied with [our work](https://github.com/krablak/global.hackathon/blob/master/README.md). Although we work as a team, we have dedicated roles in order to be more effective:

- Michal: most of JS and HTML coding, GoogleMaps related things, final project build (JS minification etc.)
- Radek: data gathering and machine processing using his beloved Python, some JS and HTML coding
- together we did the UI design and developed the whole idea what to code

Some photos illustrating our effort follow:)

Analysis stage of the project (Saturday and everything ahead of us...):

And the development (Sunday - we are happy because we already have something developed)

## Project
From the beginning, we were sure that we want to do something with "visualization of Earth-related data" which will be beautiful, educational or will make pople think about our planet and its future. Finally, we did an application called *Nuclear explosions on Earth* which provides an interactive vizualization of all 2000+ nuclear explosions which already happened (mostly as nuclear weapon tests) on our planet. Dedicated project page is  [here](https://github.com/krablak/global.hackathon/blob/master/README.md).
